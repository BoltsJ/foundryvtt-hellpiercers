## Basics

- [ ] Character Sheets (blocked on lack of sheets)
- [ ] Swarm tech - track tokens and actors associated with a swarm
- [ ] Targeting - In progress
- [ ] Attack dialogs
- [ ] Damage Application
- [ ] STRATCOM layer - Possibly base/map interaction
- [ ] Drag Ruler + Terrain layer
- [ ] Turn tracking (adapt Lancer Initiative)

## Stretch goals
